# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis


**Description:** 

Customer segmentation involves dividing a business's customer base into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors. By applying clustering algorithms, we can identify these unique segments within the customer data. Each segment represents a group of customers with similar characteristics, such as buying habits, preferences, and spending patterns.


**Why We Use It:**

Understanding these customer segments is crucial for businesses to target specific groups with personalized marketing strategies. By catering to the unique needs and preferences of each segment, businesses can increase customer satisfaction, improve retention rates, and enhance overall marketing efficiency. Tailored marketing efforts lead to more effective communication, better customer experiences, and ultimately, higher sales and profitability.


**Tasks:**

*  Collect and preprocess customer data from dataset. 
*  Apply clustering algorithms.
*  Analysis and interpret the clusters. 
*  Present findings with visualizations. 


**Work Flow will be follow as:**

1. Customer data:
   
   Gather customer data, including attributes such as annual income and spending score, to analyze purchasing behavior and segment the customer base.
   
2. Data Preprocessing:
   
   Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables to prepare for analysis.
   
3. Data Analysis:
   
   Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns, correlations, and trends within the customer data, providing insights into customer behavior.

4. Optimum number of clusters:
   
   Determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to ensure effective segmentation.
   
5. K-Means Clustering Algorithm using WCSS:
   
   Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm and evaluate cluster quality using the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to refine and validate the clustering process.
  
6. Visualizing the clusters:
   
   Create visual plots to display the identified clusters and their centroids, aiding in the interpretation and understanding of customer segments.
