# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis


**Description:** 

Customer segmentation involves dividing a business's customer base into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors. By applying clustering algorithms, we can identify these unique segments within the customer data. Each segment represents a group of customers with similar characteristics, such as buying habits, preferences, and spending patterns.


**Why We Use It:**

Understanding these customer segments is crucial for businesses to target specific groups with personalized marketing strategies. By catering to the unique needs and preferences of each segment, businesses can increase customer satisfaction, improve retention rates, and enhance overall marketing efficiency. Tailored marketing efforts lead to more effective communication, better customer experiences, and ultimately, higher sales and profitability.


**Tasks:**

*  Collect and preprocess customer data from dataset. 
*  Apply clustering algorithms.
*  Analysis and interpret the clusters. 
*  Present findings with visualizations. 


**Work Flow will be follow as:**

1. Customer data
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Analysis
4. Optimum number of clusters 
5. K-Means Clustering Algorithm
6. Visualizing the clusters


The output of this project will be:
